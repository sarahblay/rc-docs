# Setting up consults in LibCal

We use the LibCal appointments module.

1. [Log in to LibCal here](https://library-ubc-ca.libapps.com/libapps/login.php?site_id=9123&target=).

You should see an appointments tab in the main menu:

If you do not see this tab reach out to your team lead or Sarah.

2. The Appointments landing page looks like this:

This is where you can quickly see a list of upcoming appointments, delete appointments, and book additional appointments as necessary.

3. Setting your Availability.

Here is an example of a weekly availability booking from 1:00pm to 3:00pm on Tuesdays and Thursdays for the NVivo team.

Things to keep in mind:
* Location needs to always be set to "Research Commons".
* Always select your group.
* Use "Directions Override" when you need to include additional information for a user. For example, you might want to use this if this specific block of availability is in the Digital Scholarship Lab instead of a Consult Room.
* The default bookable time unit is "60 minutes" with no padding between appointments so setting 1:00pm to 3:00pm means that you are available for 1 60 minute booking. Users can also optionally specify whether they want to book you for a short (30 minutes) or a long consultation (60 minutes) when they book.

4. Customizing default settings under "My Settings". Any changes made here are unique to you and don't affect other users of LibCal appointments.

The default settings are:

Each team should connect with their team lead about adding additional questions to the booking form.
