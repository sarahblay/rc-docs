# Room Setup
[Using the Microphones](#using-the-microphones)
# VGA or HDMI (with adapters if needed)

Please do not use Air Media to present workshops in the Presentation Room. It is failing more often than it is not failing and IT and others have already explained that the technology is not reliable enough for this purpose. 
Please save yourself the stress of mid-workshop failure and use the HDMI or VGA connectors. If you do not have a VGA or HDMI output on your laptop, please go to Room 497A (Map Printer Room) and borrow one of the two adapters shown below.

They are in the marked cupboard in Room 545 in Koerner Library:

# Using the Microphones
For both the handheld and lapel mics, you need to find the secret ON button to make them work.

## Where are the microphones stored?
Both microphones for the Presentation Room are stored in the cupboard in Room 545. All UBC Library Research Commons employees have access to this room. Note that microphone (lapel) for the Digital Scholarship Lab is stored in the Map Printer Room beside the Digital Scholarship Lab. It is in a marked cupboard which is locked. All UBC Library Research Commons employees also have access to this room and a key for that cupboard.

## Accessing ON button for handheld mic:
1. Twist the body of the mic to the left to loosen. Once loose, pull the handle shell down to reveal the buttons.<br>

2. The ON/OFF button is the tiny grey button closest to the bottom of the controls.

## Accessing ON button for lapel mic:
1. Unlatch the release buttons on both sides of the unit simultaneously to release the front door. The image shows the release button on one side.

## When batteries die for mics:
1. There are backup batteries in the cupboard in the Map Printer Room (497A) and in Staff Room 545. The battery charger is in Room 545. Grab the batteries right away when you need them.
2. Make sure to charge dead batteries right away. 
3. Only put charged batteries back in the basket in Room 497A and the cardboard box in Room 545. This will keep the flow of live batteries alive!!
