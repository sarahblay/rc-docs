# Booking consult rooms
You don't have to worry about booking your consult room for your usual three hours of consults per week. The UBC Library Research Commons Program Manager will block those hours on your behalf. The rooms are heavily used though, and sometimes you may decide to book an appointment outside your normal hours. In this case you need to book the room yourself.

# Booking a consult room:

1. Login to the [research.commons@ubc.ca](mailto:research.commons@ubc.ca) using online webmail.
1. Go to the calendar.
1. In the calendar book a new appointment as you would normally. There are two extra steps you need to take to secure the room.
   1. In the Location box, click Add Room.
   1. Now scroll down the list until you see the Research Commons Consult Rooms as shown in the image. Make sure the room you want  is free at the time you want. With your times selected, it should say (Free) in brackets.
   1. With the room selected, click Send on your appointment. You can invite others, such as a client, but even if it is just going to be you, you need to click Send to "invite" the room.
   1. An email message will arrive that says the room booking is Accepted. If you instead receive a Declined message, you cannot use it at that time (as it is already booked). Please choose another room and follow the same process again.
